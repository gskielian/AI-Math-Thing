Join us in the quest to create algorithms which optimize the learning curve!


## Roadmap


Markov Chains mod, doesn't add up 1, leaky transitions also kept, but only interested in the ones which hold water.
Markov Chains interest, 


### Weight different sized groups

we are more interested in the paths which repeat themselves less often this is to the learning curve affects observed
at the UCLA Learning & Forgetting Labs [link](http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/01/everything-about-learning/)

We look here for the prospect

larger groups are less susceptible to vestige, as the diversity within states and long delay between global repetitions act as a low pass for noise.
