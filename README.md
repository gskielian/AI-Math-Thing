Learning Curve Optimization
===========================

Join us in the quest to create algorithms for developing curricula which optimize the learning curve!




## Roadmap

Markov Chains mod, doesn't add up 1, leaky transitions also kept, but only interested in the ones which hold water.
These will be the groups (approximate groups which feedback into themselves, although not necessarily in a fixed sequence, hence *groups are not necessarily loops*)

Groups are interesting as opposed to the simple loops as well because of they have freedom on the permutation of operations (loops are to groups as circle is to conic section)



### Model the mind as a set of states and a set of transitions

Self-explanatory, and each stable state turns out to be a group, and the transitions are quantized very similarly to how quantum mechanics either has a "successful" transition or none at all.



### Group closure is weighted

Paths that are traversed before are easier to traverse a second time, i.e. priming.  Once the conduits are primed it is more probable that they will be traversed again.

Organisms tend to gravitate towards groups for good reason I conjecture: they seek to conserve their energy and effectively utilize excess energy in times of surplus (which requires predicting future needs).

Like a genetic algorithm, the relative primings which survive are those which conserve energy by reusing previous paths while minimizing the number of operations.

In linear algebra we see the aesthetic value of minimizing our set up basis vectors.


### Psychological Energy Gradient

In physics a spatial energy gradient is called a Force (things feel "pushed" towards lower energy state, i.e. more probable)

This is a psychological energy gradient, so under analogously is a psychological force.  The same rules seem therefore to apply for the short run: larger energy gradient = larger force, higher probability of this decision.


### Railroad analogy

Now suppose you had an energy spike, and can use that energy to prime a bunch of conduits in the mind to enhance the ease, quickness, etc of performing those actions in the future.
However, there are many possible things to prime, what you will need to know the future, what to expect, and then you can prime the operations which
you will need (or would be energetically favorable).

Pretend you were building a railroad and had enough supplies to build on multiple fronts (instead of myopically extending the railroad forwards)

Well you might want to build with another group elsewhere (not too close, becuase it would recreate the initial dilemma of having only one front), so that eventually
you may connect the two roads into a larger one.  If the energy would otherwise be wasted (priming of things which were harmful or wasteful), then there would be an imperative towards seeing this out.

This is like the model being described, but with time.  You can pre-prime the conduits for situations in the future, and hopefully you will actually see that future.
If you do not see that future, then your energy will have been a waste.


### Application of Psychological Gradients

This brings us to an interesting and easily testable phenomenon of this framework.

if you
1. prime disparate conduits which would be connected via first or near first association
2. create a group of such conduits

then you will create in the subject their own psychological gradient.  The 

minimizing the types of operations needed to connect the group is a must to gain short term conditioning momentum.

The group closure will then "lock in" the state, and you will have created a stable psychological state.

The operation which connected the group will be heavily primed.



### Weight different sized groups -- not too small (they quickly become annoying and lack the higher-order boost)

we are more interested in the paths which repeat themselves less often this is to the learning curve affects observed
at the UCLA Learning & Forgetting Labs [link](http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/01/everything-about-learning/)

We look here a priori for prospective paths.


larger groups are less susceptible to vestige, as the diversity within states and long delay between global repetitions act as a low pass for noise.
